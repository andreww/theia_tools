theia_tools
===========

Tools for data analysis from mantle convection simulation
using TERRA and theia "plugin" to track texture development.

Currently this is under heavy development and the respository 
contains a mixture of pure TERRA tools (to look at the standard
output files) and tools to look at the particle data from Theia.
